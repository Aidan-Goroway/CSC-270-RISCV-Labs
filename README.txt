Its lab 5 + 6, the as required for the project.

The main resources I used for this assignment were as follows:

    - The RARS 1.6 RISC-V Simulator, as you advised via Slack.
        - https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars/releases/tag/v1.6

    - This handy RISC-V Refference Sheet I used to keep track of the registers.

Have a nice Spring break.
